Welcome to kEDM's documentation!
================================

kEDM (Kokkos-EDM) is a high-performance implementation of the `Empirical
Dynamical Modeling (EDM) <https://sugiharalab.github.io/EDM_Documentation/>`_
framework. The goal of kEDM is to provide an optimized and parallelized
implementation of EDM algorithms for HPC hardware (Intel Xeon, AMD EPYC,
NVIDIA GPUs, Fujitsu A64FX, etc.) while ensuring compatibility with the
reference implementation `cppEDM <https://github.com/SugiharaLab/cppEDM>`_
