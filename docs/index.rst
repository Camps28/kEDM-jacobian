Welcome to kEDM's documentation!
================================

kEDM (Kokkos-EDM) is a high-performance implementation of the `Empirical
Dynamical Modeling (EDM) <https://sugiharalab.github.io/EDM_Documentation/>`_
framework. The goal of kEDM is to provide an optimized and parallelized
implementation of EDM algorithms for high-end CPUs and GPUs, while ensuring
compatibility with the original reference implementation 
`cppEDM <https://github.com/SugiharaLab/cppEDM>`_.
